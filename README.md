# tascartutorials

This is a collection of tutorials for TASCAR. TASCAR is a toolbox for low-delay and interactive acoustic scene creation and rendering. See the [tascar.org](https://tascar.org/) website for news and installation instructions.

These tutorials are the material for our annual TASCAR workshop. These files are constantly being improved. If you have any suggestions, please submit a pull request.

You may use these tutorial files together with all required sound files [here](https://github.com/gisogrimm/tascartutorials/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). They were tested with TASCAR version 0.233. 

[First stepts](firststeps/README.md)

Currently we offer these tutorials:

1. [Sensors, real-time interaction and data logging](sensors/README.md)
2. [Interfacing from MATLAB/GNU Octave for adaptive measurements](matlab/README.md)
3. [Interactive Binaural Synthesis, Head Tracking, and openMHA](binaural/README.md)
4. [Image source model, diffuse sound fields and reverberation](roomacoustics/README.md)
5. [Programming TASCAR: Develop your own plugins](dev/README.md)

Some of these tutorials require equipment that is specific to our lab, but it should be possible to follow most of them on any PC (Linux / MacOS / Windows).
