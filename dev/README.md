# Programming TASCAR: Develop your own plugins


## Prerequisites

Open a terminal and navigate to the `tascartutorials/dev` directory:
```bash
cd tascartutorials/dev
```

Ensure the JACK server is running (e.g., start it with `qjackctl &`).

If not yet installed, install the package libtascar-dev:
```
sudo apt-get install libtascar-dev
```

Then follow the instructions here:

This tutorial requires a current Ubuntu LTS operating system. For plugin development on other operating systems, see the [github CI workflows](https://github.com/gisogrimm/tascar/tree/master/.github/workflows) for MacOS and Windows/MSYS.
