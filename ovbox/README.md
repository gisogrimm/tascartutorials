# Interactive communication and data transmission via the internet

The [OVBOX system](https://ovbox.de) was originally developed during the pandemic for playing rhythmic music via the internet. The key features are low-latency transmission and spatialisation of audio. Internally it consists of a system for exchanging and distributing UDP messages, and a subset of TASCAR functionality for audio processing.

For this tutorial we assume you have a Raspberry Pi based OVBOX, and a desktop client (during the TASCAR workshop we will provide them). Basic knowledge of TASCAR and of network communication is required.

## Step 1: low-delay acoustic communication with the OVBOX



## Step 2: Using a head tracker for dynamic binaural rendering and remote source movement

## Step 3: Recording of audio signals

## Step 4: Recording of speech levels and head movement
